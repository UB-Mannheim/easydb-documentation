# Welcome to the easydb documentation

## General
 
easydb is a flexible web application that allows customers to manage data and information for images and multimedia. easydb has a wide range of possible applications and is often used as a pure image database or for uniform media management for e.g. photos, information, videos, PDFs, office-files and metadata.

easydb has a flexible data model that allows each instance to be tailored to customer needs.

This document describes in general the concepts and mechanisms required for easydb use. Under [Solutions](./solutions/solutions.md) you can find information on prefabricated solutions. Individual documentation for instances with customer-specific requirements can be ordered additionally.

## Note

The documentation is only available as an online version. Therefore, we recommend a screen with a resolution of at least 1280 × 1024 pixels. Using the print function in the browser menu, you can print out parts of the documentation.

The documentation includes the technical description, the instructions for use and explanatory notes.

## Support

We will remedy faults in the following timeframe depending on the fault class (if booked by the customer and not otherwise agreed):

|Deficiency class|Reaction time|Recovery time|

|Preventive shortage|     2 hours|             24 hours = 3 working days|
