The calculation and management of all assets (images, videos,
Office documents, etc.), which you manage with the easydb.

[Main ingredients](./installation/installation.md)

[Configuration at program start](./initconf/initconf.md)

[Partitions](./partitions/partitions.md)

This service is also used by the easydb4, which makes the migration to the
Easydb5 is significantly simplified at this point.

> There are path paths therefore refer to paths in the container, not to paths directly on your server, which runs the docker container.
