# Detailed view

The detail view for a data record appears either on the right side of the sidebar or on the full screen.

## Sidebar

In the sidebar, the [File Viewer](../../features/datatypes/datatypes.md#tools) appears in the upper area, which you can turn on and off with <i class="fa fa-image"></i>. This state is stored in your user profile.

Select a download size for the file field you want to download. Select an option to export the metadata profile and the file name. You can also enter your own filename. You can use the substitutions that are also available for the object types under [*File names for export and download*](../../../rightsmanagement/objecttypes/objecttypes.md).

The download is a ZIP file.


## Full screen

You can scroll through lists in full screen. At the bottom there is an overview with previews. At the top left, you can use <code class="button">Detail</code> to display more information about the record. With <i class =" fa fa-expand "> </i> you can enlarge the full screen to the whole screen and with <i class="fa fa-times"> </i> you close the full-screen view. In the upper left corner <i class="fa fa-search-plus"> </i>, the zommer is activated to show details enlarged.

With <i class="fa fa-chevron-left"> </i> and <i class = "fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden = "true"> </i> next to the displayed record can move to the next Record. The preview bar can be moved to the left and right using the appropriate icons at the edge. Records containing other assets are grouped by a border, as shown in the screenshot.

> NOTE: If the full-screen icon is gray (= disabled) in the full-screen view in the asset browser as well as in the asset detail, the user has not activated full-screen mode on his browser.

## Divide

From the top of the Data View, you can share <i class="fa fa-share"></i> the record or the file that is associated with the record from the corresponding field. For more information on sharing and releasing via links, see the [DeepLinks](../../features/deeplinks/deeplinks.md) section.
