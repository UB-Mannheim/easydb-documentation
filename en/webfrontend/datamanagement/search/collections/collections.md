# Quick access 

The quick access allows you to manage sets of data sets. These are, on the one hand, dynamic portfolios, such as stored searches and ad hoc portfolios for data records processed on a daily basis. And on the other hand, manual compilations, including own and shared folders. With <code class="button"> < </code> the quick access can be switched on and off.

## Overview in quick access

![Folders](finder.png)

Easydb offers the following folders in the folder overview:

|Colleciton|Subordinate|Description|
|--|--|--|
|<i class="fa fa-search"></i> Search||Corresponds to the current number of records available to you in easydb. From a map you can go directly back to the main search via this route.|
||<i class="fa fa-search"></i> Today edited | Contains the records you edited today. The current day date is used for this purpose, therefore 0:00 to 23:59 of the current day. For more complex searches that go back in time, a query of the [change history](../../features/datatypes/datatypes.html#changelog-search) can be carried out in the [expert search](../search.html#expert).|
||<i class="fa fa-search"></i> Created |The records that you created today.|
||<i class="fa fa-search"></i> Edited| Records that were edited by you today.|
|<i class="fa fa-search"></i> Saved Search||The results of a search can be stored in the <i class = "fa fa-floppy-o"> </i> menu and can be accessed again at this point. This folder is dynamic. All the records matching the saved search criteria are displayed.|
| My Collections || User-created sets of records. |
| Shared Collections || Compilation of records shared by other users. The authorizations are applied to the folder that the creator has assigned
