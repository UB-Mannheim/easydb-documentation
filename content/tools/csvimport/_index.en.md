# CSV Importer

Via the CSV importer masses of data can be imported and updated in easydb. This can be simple lists, hierarchical thesauri or image and object information. 

You can create the data for example in Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers or Notepad++. If you work with Excel or Numbers, you have to save the data as .csv with UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding before importing. Uploading files of type .xls, .xlsx or .numbers is not supported.

Please also refer to the [general notes](./general). Under [Data types](./datatypes) you can read how to format the data in the CSV file. Step-by-step instructions can be found at [Examples](./examples) and all options of the CSV importer are described [here](./options).
