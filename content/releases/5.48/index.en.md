> A new system right **Access only for collections (research without search function)** has been added. We will **remove** the old system right **Search not allowed (collection-only users)** in **Version 5.50.0** (planned publication on 02.05.2019). Make sure to change your rights management to the new right by then.

# Version 5.48.1

*Published on 27.03.2019*

### Web frontend

*New*

- **JSON Importer**: There is now an explicit prepare button to load the payloads. This separates the verification of the payloads from the actual upload.
- **Change history**: For the change history, the **read permission** for the object required is now sufficient. 

*Improved*

- Improved **performance** when rendering the **detail display** with many tabs. In particular, switching between tabs is now faster than before.
- **All available tools** are now loaded when **selecting** in Search, Secondary Search and Folders, i.e. Editor, Group Editor and others are now available in all context menus as well as in the 3-point menus.
- **ScriptRunner**: The search of the objects is now completely performed before the script for the objects is started. This ensures that the number of objects does not change during a run, e.g. due to tags updated by a script or other metadata that would affect the search result.
- **ScriptRunner**: When used in hierarchical lists, a search is now performed as for export. This also includes all child objects in the run.
- Small graphical improvements in different dialogs.

*Fixed*

- Fixed the **display of a message** that did not require confirmation. If the message type has previously allowed confirmation, this confirmation has also been included in the changed type.

### Server

*New*

- **/api/db** and **/api/search**: In full format, _changelog is now also published for users who only have the **READ** right for the object and the system right **frontend_features[changelog]**.

*New*

- New system right **Access only for collections (research without search function)** was added.
- The status of the **Quick access** is now automatically saved for each user. The status is also stored in the group profiles for new users.

- In the **Debug Mode** of the web frontend, all rights are now displayed with their API name.

- **New plugin interface** to include own tabs in the **pool manager**, which can then save custom data.

*Improved*

- The **pool/object type selection** and **sort selection** no longer have an **Apply** button. The selection is automatically activated when clicking outside the selection. This dialog behaves analogous to the other smaller dialogs in the search.

- New Coffeescript UI version with improved **tooltip behavior** and new rules for form spacing in the display.

- **Print** output improvements for some browsers.
- Editor: When **changing a pool** in objects with reverse nested objects that are also in pools, the pool is also updated for the nested objects.
- **Change history**: The user names of the changes are only displayed if the user has write permission for the object, otherwise only the time of the change is displayed.
- Pool manager: Support for more than **1000 pools**.
- **Metadata mapping**: Field names are now displayed with full path.
