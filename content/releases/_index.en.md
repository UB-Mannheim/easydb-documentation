# Releases

easydb is regularly updated with new functions, error solutions, and overall improvements

* A new version is prepared every 3 weeks and, - if appropriate for customers - published, and is then ready to be updated.
* Bug fixes can create additional versions (also called "patches").

## Update

[Updating](../sysadmin/operations/#update) is the same as the first steps of the installation process. Unless you have an active support contract, this task and responsibility of the customer.

easydb instances on our own servers, including tests and presentations, are updated by us.
