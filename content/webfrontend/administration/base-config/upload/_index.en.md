# Upload

This tab defines global limits for uploads (uploading assets in easydb).

| Settings | | Explanation |
| ------ |---| -------- |
| Upload limit | | The global upload limit in bytes. If an upload is larger, it is rejected in any case, even if other values ​​are set by means of the management. |
| _File class_ | Limit | A separate limit can be defined per file class. If it is larger than the global upload limit, it is ignored. |
| | Type | Only the formats for an upload are accepted, which are activated here. For the file class _Sonstige_, all formats that are not listed in one of the other file classes are always allowed. |
