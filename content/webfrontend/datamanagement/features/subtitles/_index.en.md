# Videos with subtitles

In order for subtitles to be displayed for videos in the video player, the subtitles must be available as separate VTT files.

If the file names of the video file and the VTT file match - e.g. video.mp4 and video.vtt - both files can be uploaded in one step. It is important to activate "Detect versions" in the upload dialog, so that only one data set is created for both files, in which both files are stored as versions.

Alternatively, the video file can be uploaded first as usual and in a second step the VTT files can be uploaded as additional versions via the 3-dot menu of the file field.

The file name of the subtitle file is then displayed in the video player for selection.
