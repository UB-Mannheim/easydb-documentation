# Search

![Constitution](search_structure_en.png)

The search is called in the main menu via the <i class = "fa fa-search" aria-hidden = "true"> </i> button.

## Construction

| Area | Note |
|---|---|
| Quick access | Quick access is similar to a bookmark in the browser, and includes *Saved searches*, *Edited Today* and *Collections* organized into custom and shared folders
|Search | The line  *Search* can be used to select which pools and object types to search for. In the search field, a full-text search can be carried out with any number of search elements. On the right, the *Expert search* can be opened to search specifically in selected fields. Both options together with the filters can be combined with each other |
| Filter | By combining *Filters*, the amount of hits can be sharpened step by step. |
| Display and sorting | The display can be selected as a gallery, text or table from the layout, and the display type can be defined more precisely. The results can be sorted in two steps. For this purpose, a primary and a secondary criterion is optionally selected
| Hit Display | Displays the hits as a result of the search. Without input in the search, all available records are displayed in descending ID order
| Detailed View and Editor|  A selected record from the hits can be opened in the *detail view*. For this, the detailed view can be displayed as shown in the *Sidebar* or in the full screen. From the detailed view or, optionally, the context menu, the *Editor* can be started to edit records. |
