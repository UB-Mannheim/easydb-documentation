# Asset

Assets are uploaded to the EAS using one of the following calls:

- [POST /api/eas/put](/en/technical/api/eas): upload a file
- [POST /api/eas/produce](/en/technical/api/eas): produce an asset based on another one (setting `eas_parent_id` accordingly)

These calls return an asset record. The asset record is linked to an object using
[POST /api/db]. The call must provide the asset `_id` and can also set or update the fields
marked as writable in the table below.

### <a name="versions"></a> Versions

Versions are specified as a map. The EAS rights management configuration specifies which versions are visible:

- if the asset is linked to an object, the versions are filtered by their asset rights
- if the asset is not linked to an object, all known versions are visible

For each version, there is an attribute with the following properties (read-only):

| Name                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `status`                    | Processing status (string): **pending**, **processing** or **done** |

| `class`                     | File class (string) |
| `extension`                 | File extension (string) |
| `url`                       | URL (string) |
| `zoom_url`                  | Zoom URL (string) |

### <a name="duplicate"></a> duplicate

Each duplicate is a map with the following properties:

| Name                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `_id`                       | Asset ID    |
| `certainty`                 | currently always `1.0` |
| `linked_system_objects`     | list of objects linking this asset, currently at most one object |
